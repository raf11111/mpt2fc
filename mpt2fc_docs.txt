# Proof of concept ModplugTracker to Future Composer pattern converter
#
# Rafal Szyja (Raf/Vulture Design), June 2015

DANGER:
PRELIMINARY RELEASE, lacks some features which already should be implemented.

Usage:

1.
run VICE:
x64.exe -remotemonitor

2.
Run terminal software (I use RealTerm) and connect to VICE:

localhost:6510

You need/should connect with these settings enabled:
raw socket, 
ascii, 
half duplex, 
newline

connecting opens up monitor like alt+m in VICE but it's accessible from terminal allowing external software to interfere with emulation (inject bytes into memory in our case). Disconnecting does resume emulator. NOTE this is explaination, you don't need to connect at this time.

3. 
Run mpt2fc.py (hardcoded to transform x.txt file)
you will get output like

> 7000 C3 3C 85 3C 48 C2 48 C3 48 3C 85 38 85 38 44 C2 48 C3 44 38 85 35 85 35 41 C2 48 C3 41 35 85 3A 85 3A 46 C2 48 C3 46 3A ff

4. 

Let the show go on:

4.1 Go to Future Composer, put cursor in track edit mode (ctrl + 1~3) (no block editing).
4.2 connect to remote monitor (vice will pause)
4.3 paste that > 7000 ... ff created by python script and [enter]
4.4 disconnect (vice will resume)
4.5 edit block #0 and voila... (7100 is block #1 and so on)

TO SUM UP....
Obviously this software needs polishing and input parameters like filename and destination block# but I wanted to share this little tool with you before end of Future Composer Compo deadline.

You can copy Modplug patterns by using ctrl+l, ctrl+c, pasting into notepad and saving, just remeber that first line with "modplug" text needs to be deleted.
